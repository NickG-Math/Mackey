# Mackey
This is a project devoted to numerically computing the RO(G) homology of a point. 

There are three ways you can use it:

* For a quick demonstration in the case of G=C4, you can run the binary for your OS from the <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/Mackey/tree/master/bin">bin</a> folder.
* If you are familiar with MATLAB, then you can get an earlier prototype of this project written in MATLAB from the sister <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/C4-Homology">repository</a>. Note that the MATLAB code is quite a bit behind this current project. 
* The current project is a header-only library written in C++. For a user-guide as well as extensive documentation, please refer to the Github page <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Mackey/html/index.html">here</a>.
