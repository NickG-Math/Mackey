# Mackey
This is a project devoted to numerically computing the RO(G) homology of a point. 

There are three ways you can use it:

* For a quick demonstration in the case of G=C4, you can run the binary for your OS from the <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/Mackey/tree/master/bin">bin</a> folder.
* If you are familiar with MATLAB, then you can get an earlier prototype of this project written in MATLAB from the sister <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/C4-Homology">repository</a>. While it's fully documented, it's important to note that the MATLAB code is somewhat out-of-date, compared to the current project. 
* This project is a header-only library written in C++. It's more general, more modular and extensible, and about 20-30 times faster than the MATLAB version. To get started with a user-guide/tutorial, please refer to this Github <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Mackey/html/index.html">page</a>. It also contains extensive documentation for every method and class of the project.
