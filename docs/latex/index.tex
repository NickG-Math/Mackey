\hypertarget{index_intro}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro}
This is a C++ header only library devoted to numerically computing $RO(G)$ homology. You can find the Git\+Hub repository \href{https://github.com/NickG-Math/Mackey}{\texttt{ here}}.

For a quick demonstration in the case of $G=C_4$, use one of the available binaries \href{https://github.com/NickG-Math/Mackey/releases}{\texttt{ here}}.\hypertarget{index_req}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{index_req}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C++17.
\item \href{ http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page}{\texttt{ Eigen}}, a header only library for matrix manipulation. The code has been tested with \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceEigen}{Eigen}} 3.\+3.\+9.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Optionally\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For serialization we have integrated support for the \href{https://uscilab.github.io/cereal}{\texttt{ cereal}} library.
\item To draw the multiplication graphs you can use \href{https://www.graphviz.org}{\texttt{ Graphviz}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_install}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_install}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To install simply clone/download the \href{https://github.com/NickG-Math/Mackey}{\texttt{ repository}} and include the folder called \char`\"{}source\char`\"{} in your path. You will also need to include \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceEigen}{Eigen}} and, if serialization is desired, cereal.
\item See the page \mbox{\hyperlink{use}{How to Use}} for a tutorial on using the library.
\item As for compiler support, the latest version of the code is always tested with the latest stable versions of Clang, G\+CC (Linux) and M\+S\+VC (Windows). Remember to use the option {\ttfamily -\/std=c++17}. For more information on compiler options, see the \mbox{\hyperlink{perf}{Performance}} page.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The project is almost complete for $G$ a cyclic group of prime power order. The only input that\textquotesingle{}s needed are the bottom level equivariant chains for the spheres corresponding to actual (as opposed to virtual) representations; we call these \char`\"{}standard chains\char`\"{}. The standard chains can be easily computed from geometric equivariant decompositions by hand, and then fed into the program as explained in \mbox{\hyperlink{use_how}{Step 0\+: Setting the Group Parameters}}. We have implemented this for all groups $G=C_{2^n}$.
\item Frobenius relations are yet to be implemented\+: The multiplicative structure is computed levelwise, but this could be done more effectively using the Frobenius relations.
\item For general cyclic groups a few aspects that involve transferring need reworking. For non-\/prime-\/power cyclic groups, the subgroup diagram is not a vertical tower but a somewhat more complicated diagram, so care has to be taken to account for all these extra transfers and restrictions. Ultimately this is the only part that needs changing.
\item The bulletpoint above also applies to general finite abelian groups. We also need to specify the order of the elements of the group and how they relate to the subgroup diagram to form our equivariant bases.
\item For non abelian groups, the real representation theory of the group would also be needed together with the standard chains.
\item Non constant coefficients are not supported (transferring becomes more complicated when non cyclic modules are involved in the free \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceMackey}{Mackey}} functors).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_doc}{}\doxysection{Documentation}\label{index_doc}
This documentation is organized in pages as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The pages \mbox{\hyperlink{index}{General Information}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{math}{From Math to Code}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{use}{How to Use}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{algo}{Select Implementation Details}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{perf}{Performance}} explain how the program works, starting from the math and moving to slightly more technical territory regarding the actual implementation.
\item The pages \href{namespaces.html}{\texttt{ Namespaces}}, \href{annotated.html}{\texttt{ Classes}} and \href{files.html}{\texttt{ Files}} are automatically generated by doxygen from the source code (and comments in the source code). These offer a much more indepth look into all classes and functions of this project. Note that only public and protected members and named namespaces are documented.
\item I recommend starting with the \href{namespaces.html}{\texttt{ related pages}} before moving to the automatically generated ones. If you just want to use this library for computations, you only really have to go over the \mbox{\hyperlink{use_how}{Step 0\+: Setting the Group Parameters}} section.
